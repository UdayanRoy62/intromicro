    "text": "Preface\nThese are my lecture notes for a course called Introduction to Microeconomics that I have taught for over three decades.\nThe required textbook for my course is Principles of Microeconomics by N. Gregory Mankiw. Although Mankiw’s book is excellent, I have constantly felt the need to make small adjustments. Until recently, I had been making these adjustments in the PowerPoint slides I use in the classroom. But the availability of new technology – especially R, R Studio, quarto books, and Github – has made it easy for me to gather my slides and give them an online form that actually resembles a textbook.\nThis is definitely a work in progress. I am writing up my notes in my spare time.\nI would be happy to get feedback. Please email me: udayan.roy@liu.edu.",

    "section": "1.3 What is the Use of Economics?",
    "text": "1.3 What is the Use of Economics?\nScarcity compels us to come up with less wasteful ways of running our societies.\nWe all want progress, and we all want to reduce hunger, poverty and inequality. But our resources are finite. Therefore, we can’t afford to run our societies in wasteful and inefficient ways. That’s where good economic policies have a crucial role to play. That’s where the economist can contribute.\nThe goals of a nation should not be set by economists. In democracies, it is usually the job of the elected representatives of the people to determine the nation’s goals. Once the goals have been determined, it is the job of the economist to outline the various policies by which the nation’s goals may be reached (assuming the goals are reachable).\nThe economist must also predict the likely benefits and costs of each of the various policies by which the nation’s goals may be achieved.\nThe people’s representatives can then pick the policy they like best.\n\n1.3.1 Wasted Resources: Stuck in Traffic\nWe waste a lot of time stuck in traffic. Economists would want to find a way to reduce this waste of time. Building more roads may not always be possible, may not solve the problem, and may be costly in any case. Charging car owners for the use of a road may be the way to go. Investing in or subsidizing public transport is another option.\n\n1.3.1.1 Wasted Resources: Stuck in Traffic: News Item\nCharging Drivers for Road Use Is Popular With Economists, Less So With Drivers By David Harrison, The Wall Street Journal, Aug. 29, 2021\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Wasted Resources: Unemployment\nWhat can we do to reduce this waste of resources? Cut taxes to encourage people to go shopping? Have the government spend more roads and bridges? Make overtime work illegal? Limit imports?\n\n\n1.3.3 Wasted Resources: Environment Destruction\nHow can we ensure that the resources that sustain life on this planet are conserved?\n\n\n1.3.4 Addressing Ethical Imperatives: Health Care\nHow can we ensure that people do not need to worry about something as basic as healthcare?\n\n\n1.3.5 Addressing Ethical Imperatives: Inequality\nHow can we ensure that incomes are more equally shared?\nThis assumes that a more equal nation is what the people want. (Remember that it is not the economist’s job to say what the nation should or should not want.) Raise taxes on the rich? Invest in and subsidize higher education? Change existing laws to strengthen labor unions?\n\n\n1.3.6 Addressing Ethical Imperatives: Intergenerational Mobility\nHow can we keep the American Dream—the idea that each generation lives better than their parents—alive? Universal Basic Income? Baby Bonds? Require politicians to raise election campaign money through small donations? Tuition-free college?",

    "text": "1.5 How Do Economists Do What They Are Expected to Do?\n\n1.5.1 Economists make simplifying assumptions\nThe simplifications help economists make predictions about the likely consequences of different policy options.\nEconomists usually disagree about their predictions. This is because different economists make different simplifying assumptions.\nThey try to use data to sort out their disagreements. If all goes well, economists may come up with unambiguous and useful advice for policy makers.\nAn actual economy is extremely complex. So, it is hard to think about how it would respond to, say, an increase in income tax rates. Therefore, it would be hard to make even a theoretical prediction of a tax hike’s effect on, say, the unemployment rate.1 So economists need to make simplifying assumptions in their analyses. They need to imagine a simpler economy because it might be easier to make a prediction for the simplified imaginary economy than for the complex actual economy.\nThese simplifying assumptions must be very carefully chosen, however, so that the hypothetical simplified economy is not too dissimilar to the actual economy, and is, at the same time, easier to analyze than the actual economy.\n\n1.5.1.1 Predictions: Examples\n\nIf income tax rates are increased, the nation’s unemployment rate will increase.\nIf Florida has a severe winter, the price of orange juice will increase.\nIf the price of imported oil goes up, the nation’s gross domestic product will decrease.\nIf the tax per airline ticket is increased, the price of hotel rooms will decrease.\n\n\n\n1.5.1.2 Predictions: Disagreements Are Inevitable\nThere is no universally accepted way for economists to decide which simplifying assumptions are the most appropriate. Different economists when asked the same question—say, How will an income tax hike affect unemployment?—may make different simplifying assumptions in their analyses. Therefore, they may end up making different predictions.\n\n\n1.5.1.3 Data Helps to Sort Out Disagreements\nWhen economists disagree, the right kind of historical evidence may help them decide which economist’s prediction to trust. A large part of the economist’s job is to dig up evidence from the past, and use the evidence to test the clashing theories that various economists may propose.",

Those disagreements can’t always be sorted out. (Why?) This leaves the general public puzzled and annoyed.\n\n1.6.1 Economists’ Disagreements Can’t Always Be Sorted Out\nOften there isn’t enough data. When there isn’t enough data, one may not be able to choose between clashing theories or predictions.\nEconomists generally can’t do experiments. Even if there is a lot of historical data, there is no guarantee that a study of the past will help in identifying the best theory or prediction.

Microeconomics deals with questions related to individual economic agents, such as households and firms.\n\n1.7.1 Macroeconomics\nMacroeconomics deals with issues related to data that give summary descriptions of the economy of an entire nation. A macroeconomist would ponder questions such as: What would happen to Uzbekistan’s unemployment rate if Japan suddenly stops trading with Uzbekistan and what policy should the government of Uzbekistan then follow? The focus would always be on Uzbekistan as a whole.\n\n\n1.7.2 Microeconomics\nMicroeconomics deals with questions related to economic variables that describe a sub-national entity, typically individual economic agents, such as households and firms.\n\n\n1.7.3 Macro and Micro Are Related\nOne cannot really do macroeconomics without simultaneously doing microeconomics. One cannot analyze an economy without studying the behavior of the individual economic units that make up that economy.\nConversely, the decisions by individuals are often guided by their expectations about incomes, interest rates, inflation, and the like. And these expectations cannot be understood without an analysis of the economy as a whole.\nHowever, in macroeconomics the microeconomic underpinnings are de-emphasized. Conversely, in microeconomics the macroeconomic foundations of people’s expectations are de-emphasized.\nThis course focuses on microeconomics.",

    "section": "2.2 Why Do We Trade?",
    "text": "2.2 Why Do We Trade?\n\nPreferences may vary (from person to person and from community to community)\nThe skills, technologies, and natural resources that we are endowed with may vary (from person to person and from community to community)\nThere may exist efficiency advantages to doing one thing rather than many things.\n\n\n2.2.1 Why Do We Trade? Because Preferences May Vary\nImagine a two-country world. Suppose fishing is the only work people do. When people go out to catch fish, equal amounts of salmon and cod always get caught in the nets. Our two countries are identical except for different preferences: people in one country like salmon and people in the other country like cod.\nNaturally, this difference in preferences will lead to trade: the salmon lovers will export the cod they catch to the cod lovers, and vice versa.\nBut, this kind of trade is not very relevant to the world we live in. So, I’ll move on.\n\n\n2.2.2 Why Do We Trade? Because we are differently endowed with skills, technologies, and natural resources\n\n2.2.2.1 Imagine a simplified version of our world\nImagine a world with:\n\nonly two goods: apples and oranges, and\nonly two people: April and Oliver.\n\nWhat amounts of each good would each person produce? And once the production is done, would April and Oliver trade with each other?\n\n\nWhy am I assuming a world with only two goods and only two people? We have seen in Chapter 1 that simplicity often helps us clarify an idea. But in that case why not assume a world with just one good and/or just one person?\n\n\n2.2.2.2 Make or Buy?\nIf you want something, would you make it yourself? Or would you make something else and then trade the thing you made for the thing you want?\nTo answer this question, you need to take the cost to you of making the thing you want and compare it with the price of buying it (from another person) instead.\nLet us begin with the cost of making something.\n\n\n2.2.2.3 Opportunity Cost\nIn our story, April can produce both apples and oranges. However, as April has a finite amount of the resources needed for production and makes full use of those resources, an increase in her production of apples will cause a decrease in her production of oranges. The decrease in April’s production of oranges that is caused by a one-unit increase in her production of apples is April’s opportunity cost of an apple.\nFor example, April’s opportunity cost of one apple may be three oranges, as in Table 2.1. In this case, April could produce an additional apple if she wishes, but then she would be forced to produce three fewer oranges.\n\n\n\nTable 2.1: Opportunity Costs: Example 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApples\nOranges\n\n\n\n\nApril\n3 oranges\n\n\n\nOliver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the opportunity cost is not measured in dollars and cents. April’s opportunity cost of an apple is the decrease in the production of oranges when one more apple is produced (or, conversely, it is the increase in the production of oranges when one less apple is produced). So, the opportunity cost of an apple is measured in oranges.\n\n\n2.2.2.4 Opportunity Cost: Generalized\nWe can step away briefly from our apples-oranges example and generalize the concept of opportunity cost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpportunity Cost: A General Definition\n\n\n\nThe opportunity cost of some thing is everything that you’ll have to give up to get that thing.\n\n\nCan you apply the concept of opportunity cost to your own life? What is the opportunity cost, for you, of taking an additional math course? List all the activities you normally engage in every day. Think about all the sacrifices you will have to make if you were to enroll in an additional math course. That’s your opportunity cost of taking an additional math course this semester.\n\n\n2.2.2.5 Opportunity Cost and Trade: What if we were all pretty similar?\nSuppose the opportunity cost of an apple is 3 oranges for both April and Oliver, as in Table 2.2. Will they trade?\n\n\n\nTable 2.2: Opportunity Costs: Example 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApples\nOranges\n\n\n\n\nApril\n3 oranges\n\n\n\nOliver\n3 oranges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo. Trade would be pointless in this case.\nOne can easily imagine April making the following pitch to Oliver: “It costs me 3 oranges to make 1 apple. So, I’ll buy 1 apple from you if you charge a price that is less than 3 oranges. Deal?”\nThis is probably how Oliver will respond: “It costs me 3 oranges to make 1 apple. So, I can sell you 1 apple for a price that is more than 3 oranges. So, sorry, no deal!”\nThis exchange illustrates the idea that trade is pointless when opportunity costs are the same for all producers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Trade Under Similar Opportunity Costs\n\n\n\nIf people have similar opportunity costs for some commodity, then they would probably not trade that commodity with each other.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2.6 Opportunity Cost and Trade: What if we were all pretty different?\nLet’s change our story a bit. Suppose the opportunity cost of 1 apple is 4 oranges for April and 2 oranges for Oliver, as in Table 2.3.\nNow, will they trade?\n\n\n\nTable 2.3: Opportunity Costs: Example 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApples\nOranges\n\n\n\n\nApril\n4 oranges\n\n\n\nOliver\n2 oranges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes!\nOne can easily imagine April making the following pitch to Oliver: “It costs me 4 oranges to make 1 apple. So, I’ll buy 1 apple from you if you charge a price that is less than 4 oranges. Deal?”\nThat is, April will offer to buy apples from Oliver at a price lower than 4 oranges per apple (because she can make an apple herself at a cost of 4 oranges per apple).\nAnd this is probably how Oliver will respond: “It costs me 2 oranges to make 1 apple. So, I can sell 1 apple to you if you pay a price that is more than 2 oranges. Given what you just said to me, it seems that we can agree to trade at a price somewhere between 2 and 4 oranges per apple. Wonderful! Let’s trade.”\nNote that Oliver will offer to sell apples to April at a price higher that 2 oranges per apple (because it costs him 2 oranges to make 1 apple).\nTherefore, April and Oliver will agree to trade at a price somewhere between 2 and 4 oranges per apple.\nOliver will sell apples to April and get paid in oranges. Conversely, April will sell oranges to Oliver and get paid in apples. April will hand over some oranges to Oliver and Oliver will hand over some apples in return.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade Occurs Under Dissimilar Opportunity Costs\n\n\n\nIf people have different opportunity costs for some commodity, then they will probably trade that commodity with each other.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2.7 Opportunity Costs Across Commodities\nCan you figure out the opportunity cost of an orange for April and for Oliver in Table 2.3? That is, can you fill in the blank cells in Table 2.3?\nHere’s the full table of opportunity costs:\n\n\n\nTable 2.4: Opportunity Costs: Example 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApples\nOranges\n\n\n\n\nApril\n4 oranges\n1/4 apples\n\n\nOliver\n2 oranges\n1/2 apples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2.8 Comparative Advantage and Opportunity Costs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparative Advantage\n\n\n\nThe producer with the lower opportunity cost in the production of a commodity is said to have a comparative advantage in the production of that commodity.\n\n\nIn our example, in the production of oranges, April has the comparative advantage. And, in the production of apples, Oliver has the comparative advantage.\n\n\n2.2.2.9 Trade and Comparative Advantage\nNote that in our example, Oliver sells apples to April. So, Oliver will increase his apple production. And, therefore, Oliver will decrease his orange production.\nNote also that Oliver has a comparative advantage – that is, Oliver has the lower opportunity cost – in the production of apples.\nSo, what trade does is to get Oliver to produce more of the product in which he has a comparative advantage and to produce less of the other product.\nConversely, in our example, April sells oranges to Oliver. Consequently, April increases her orange production. And, therefore, April decreases her apple production.\nNote also that April has a comparative advantage – that is, April has the lower opportunity cost – in the production of oranges.\nSo, what trade does is to get April to produce more of the product in which she has a comparative advantage and to produce less of the other product.\nIn general:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade Follows Comparative Advantage\n\n\n\nUnder free trade, each producer increases his/her production of the product in which he/she has a comparative advantage and decreases his/her production of the other product.\n\n\nFor this reason, free trade ensures that each product is produced at the lowest possible cost. For each product, free trade ensures the use of the best technology available.\n\n\n2.2.2.10 Opportunity Cost and Trade: Key Ideas\nOur example suggests the following important ideas that connect opportunity costs and trade.\n\nIf people have different opportunity costs for some commodity, then they will trade in that commodity.\nFor any commodity, the person whose opportunity cost is lower will be the seller and the person whose opportunity cost is higher will be the buyer.\nThe price at which the trading occurs will be somewhere between the two traders’ opportunity costs.\nEvery producer will increase his production of the commodity for which his opportunity cost is lower … and decreases his production of the commodity for which his opportunity cost is higher.\nTrade causes people to do more of what they do well and less of what they don’t do well. This is the key reason why we trade so much.\n\n\n\n2.2.2.11 Comparative Advantage and Specialization\nTrade makes people specialize in the production of the good they have a comparative advantage in. In our example, Oliver has a comparative advantage in producing apples. Trade gives the Oliver the incentive to expand apples production for sale (export) to April. That is, trade gives the Oliver the incentive to specialize in what he does best.\n\n\n2.2.2.12 The Gains From Trade\nIn our example, both April and Oliver are made better off by free trade. After all, they would not have agreed to trade otherwise. Voluntary trade between two rational people always makes both of them better off.\nWhy Is Trade Good for Us? In our example, trade benefits both April and the Oliver by enabling each of them to do only what he or she is better suited to do. Imagine what it would be like if you were required to produce everything that you needed. The situation would be similarly awful for a country that either chose not to trade with other countries or was forced to end all trade with other countries.\n\n\n2.2.2.13 Theory of Comparative Advantage\nThe Theory of Comparative Advantage says that if each person specializes in producing what he or she has a comparative advantage in, then total production of every good can increase. As a result, trade can benefit everybody.\nIn our example, the theory says that if April specializes in oranges and Oliver specializes in apples, the total production of apples can be increased and the total production of oranges can also be increased. As a result, if Oliver and April then trade, they could both benefit. But is this theory true? Theory of Comparative Advantage—Proof Suppose April increases his production of oranges by 4 oranges. Then, according to Table 1, his production of apples must decrease by 1 apple. Suppose Oliver increases his production of apples by 1.5 apples. Then his production of oranges must decrease by 3 oranges. Therefore, by making these two people specialize according to their comparative advantages, it is possible to increase the total output of apples by 0.5 apples and of oranges by 1 orange.\nWow! We have just witnessed a miracle: the miracle of trade.\nFor an individual, it is impossible to make more of one good without making less of some other good. But for the world as a whole, it is possible to produce more of all goods simultaneously if we embrace trade. The Legacy of Adam Smith and David Ricardo Adam Smith In his 1776 book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith performed a detailed analysis of trade and economic interdependence, which economists still adhere to today. David Ricardo In his 1816 book Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, David Ricardo developed the principle of comparative advantage as we know it today. Opportunity costs are related to technology Opportunity Costs and Trade We have just seen that opportunity costs are crucial for understanding trade What makes opportunity costs vary from person to person or from country to country? One answer is technology Technology Explains Opportunity Cost Key idea: Different people/countries may have different technologies and this causes them to have different opportunity costs\nLet us now see a numerical example of how differences in technology lead to differences in opportunity costs\nProduction Technologies of April and Oliver Opportunity Costs of April 1 apples → 60 minutes. 1 oranges → 15 minutes. 4 oranges → 60 minutes. Therefore, April’s opportunity cost of 1 apples is 4 oranges. Opportunity Costs of April 1 oranges → 15 minutes. 1 apples → 60 minutes. ¼ apples → 15 minutes. Therefore, April’s opportunity cost of 1 oranges is ¼ apples.\nOpportunity Costs of Oliver 1 apples → 20 minutes. 1 oranges → 10 minutes. 2 oranges → 20 minutes. Therefore, Oliver’s opportunity cost of 1 apples is 2 oranges.\nOpportunity Costs of Oliver 1 oranges → 10 minutes. 1 apples → 20 minutes. ½ apples → 10 minutes. Therefore, Oliver ’s opportunity cost of 1 oranges is ½ apples.\nReminder: Opportunity Costs and Comparative Advantage April has a comparative advantage in oranges and Oliver has a comparative advantage in apples. Technological differences are an important reason why we trade To sum up, we have so far seen that Trade happens if and only if opportunity costs vary from person to person (or from country to country) Differences in technological abilities can lead to differences in opportunity costs If you are curious: Absolute Advantage and Comparative Advantage If April can make an oranges in less time than Oliver needs to do the same, then April is said to have an absolute advantage in making oranges On the other hand, as we have seen already, if April can make an oranges at a lower opportunity cost than Oliver can, then April is said to have a comparative advantage in making oranges If you are curious: Absolute Advantage and Comparative Advantage At one point, economists thought that two people would trade if and only if each had an absolute advantage in the production of some commodity. David Ricardo, a nineteenth-century British economist, later showed that absolute advantage is irrelevant. Two people would trade if and only if each had a comparative advantage in the production of some commodity.\nGains from Trade have Nothing to Do with Technological Superiority If you are curious: Absolute Advantage and Comparative Advantage If you are curious: Absolute Advantage and Comparative Advantage If you are curious: Absolute Advantage and Comparative Advantage Exercise: calculation of opportunity costs from technology We have seen how opportunity costs can be calculated from the 2nd and 3rd columns (blue border) of the technology table below But can you do it using the 4th and 5th columns (brown border) instead?\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Graphing production possibilities\nOliver’s Production Possibilities: Further Details Oliver’s Production Possibilities Frontier Oliver’s Production Possibilities Frontier The Production Possibilities Frontier The PPF graphically illustrates the fact that we face trade-offs If either person increases his production of apples, his production of oranges must decrease. When there is no trade, each person must consume what he produces. In that case, if either person increases his consumption of apples, his consumption of oranges must decrease. April’s Production Possibilities April’s Production Possibilities Frontier The Production Possibilities Frontier Can Shift More apples and More oranges? It may be possible to increase one’s consumption of both apples and oranges—as in the last slide—if… More resources or better resources become available, or Technology becomes more advanced, or April and Oliver begin to trade More apples and More oranges? Trade can increase the overall production—and consumption—of both goods even if resources and technology remain unchanged. This is the miracle of trade.

The reliability of a prediction cannot be established without careful analysis of data (obtained either from historical observation or from experiments). But in many cases we do not have data-based measurements of the reliability of a prediction. In such cases, we can at least check whether a prediction is based on logically consistent reasoning.\nA prediction needs to come out of a theory, which is a systematic and rational use of logic. In other words, the mental tool we use to make predictions is a theory.1\nTo further explore the need for a theory of prices, consider yourself casting a vote in an election. You may want to make a rational comparison of the policies espoused by candidates A, B, and C. You will need to imagine the state of your community under policies A, B, and C. To do that you will need to imagine the behavior of the people of your community under policies A, B, and C. To do that you will need to figure out the incentives that the people of your community will face under policies A, B, and C. And, because prices are often (if not always) a crucial incentive (or even the crucial incentive), you will need to figure out the prices that the people of your community will face under policies A, B, and C. And to have a logically consistent way to predict the prices that the people of your community will face under policies A, B, and C, you will need a theory of prices.\nThis is why the theory of prices is so crucial. There is hardly a single social issue where a rational comparison of policy options would not require a theory of how prices would be affected by the policy options being compared.\nAnd that is why this entire course is about prices. Indeed, another name for microeconomics is price theory.",

    "text": "3.3 The theory of demand and supply\nThe theory of demand and supply is a simple example of an economic theory. It can be used to make predictions about:\n\nthe price and\nthe quantity traded, of some traded commodity.\n\nFor example, the theory of demand and supply can help you make a prediction about the effect of unusually cold weather on the price and the quantity traded of home heating oil in New York.\nKeep in mind that it is crucial to be able to predict prices because prices are the most important economic incentives in a market-based economy.\n\n3.3.1 Assumptions: Perfect Competition\nThe theory of supply and demand assumes that each commodity is traded by buyers and sellers dealing directly with each other in the market for that commodity. Coffee is bought and sold in the market for coffee, apples are bought and sold in the market for apples, etc.2 Any buyer in a market may buy from any seller and any seller may sell to any buyer.\nThe theory of supply and demand also assumes that commodities are traded in perfectly competitive markets. A perfectly competitive market is one in which:\n\nthere are many buyers,\nthere are many sellers, and\nall sellers sell the exact same product.\n\nAs a result, under perfect competition, the price of a commodity will be the same in every single trade of that commodity. As there are many buyers, no seller has any need to offer a special low price to a particular buyer. Similarly, as there are may sellers, no buyer has any need to pay a special high price to a particular seller. So, all buying and selling must occur at the same price and we refer to that price as the market price.3\nAs there are many buyers and many sellers all selling the same commodity, each buyer and each seller has a negligible impact on the market price: everybody is a price taker.\n\n3.3.1.1 Exercise\nAre the markets for these commodities perfectly competitive?\n\nWheat\nWhite cotton T-shirts\nAutomobiles\nCable TV in your locality\nElectricity for home use in your locality\n\n\n\n3.3.1.2 Other kinds of markets\nWhat’s the opposite of perfect competition? Imperfect competition, of course. Specifically, we will discuss:\n\nMonopoly (one seller)\nMonopolistic Competition (many sellers, differentiated products)\nOligopoly (small number of sellers)",

Why does she consume more in situation B at every possible price?\n\n3.4.6.1 Shifts in the Demand Curve Caused by Changes In Consumer Income\nAs income increases the demand for a normal good will increase.\nAs income increases the demand for an inferior good will decrease.\nExample: If restaurant food is a normal good, then Demand shifts right when incomes rise. If fast food is an inferior good, then Demand shifts left when incomes rise.\n\n\n3.4.6.2 Shifts in the Demand Curve Caused by Changes in Prices of Related Goods\nWhen a decrease in the price of one good decreases the demand for another good, the two goods are called substitutes.\nWhen a decrease in the price of one good increases the demand for another good, the two goods are called complements.\nExample: If Pepsi and Coke are substitutes, then Pepsi’s demand decreases (shifts left) when Coke’s price decreases. If Cars and gasoline are complements, then the demand for cars increases (shifts right) when the price of gas decreases.\n\n\n\n3.4.7 The Law of Demand: Explanations\nThere are two ways to explain the Law of Demand:\n\nSubstitution effect\nIncome effect\n\n\n3.4.7.1 The Law of Demand: Explanations: Substitution Effect\nWhen the price of a good decreases, consumers substitute that good instead of other competing (substitute) goods.\n\n\n3.4.7.2 The Law of Demand: Explanations: Income Effect\nA decrease in the price of a commodity is essentially equivalent to an increase in consumers’ income. That is, Lower Prices = Higher Income. Consumers respond to a decrease in the price of a commodity as they would to an increase in income. They increase their consumption of a wide range of goods, including the good that had a price decrease.\nWe have used the substitution effect and the income effect to show that the Law of Demand is true for normal goods.\nCan you imagine an example where the Law of Demand is not true?",

This is called excess supply or a surplus. In such a situation, sellers will be forced to cut their prices, thereby moving the market price closer to equilibrium.\nIf the market price is less than the equilibrium price, then the quantity supplied is less than the quantity demanded.

For example, if on one occasion we observed that the price increased 10 percent and the quantity purchased decreased 20 percent, then, assuming that all other factors that affect the quantity demanded/purchased were unchanged, we can calculate that the price elasticity of demand strawberry ice cream is -2.\nThe price increase was +10 percent. As a decrease is expressed as a negative increase, the increase in quantity demanded was -20 percent. Therefore, a one percent increase in price caused a -20/+10 = -2 percent increase in quantity demanded. Therefore, in this case at least, the P.E.D. of strawberry ice cream is determined to be -2.\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n\\text{Price Elasticity of Demand}=\\frac{\\text{\\% Increase in Quantity Demanded}}{\\text{\\% Increase in Price}}=\\frac{-20}{+10}=-2\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nRecall that in Chapter 3, we saw examples of numerical data on price and quantity demanded in demand schedules/tables and demand curves.\n\n4.3.1 We often drop the negative sign in PED computations\nRecall the Law of Demand from Chapter 3. It says that price and quantity demanded move in opposite directions (provided all the other factors that affect buyers’ decisions are unchanged). Therefore, the percent increase in price and the percent increase in quantity demanded will always be of opposite signs. Therefore, the P.E.D. formula in the previous slide will always be negative. For this reason, it is quite common to ignore the sign.\nFor the rest of this course, I will ignore the negative sign of the PED. Formally, I will add a negative sign to the PED formula to get rid of the unnecessary negative sign.\n\\[\n\\text{Price Elasticity of Demand}=-\\frac{\\text{\\% Increase in Quantity Demanded}}{\\text{\\% Increase in Price}}=-\\frac{-20}{+10}=+2\n\\tag{4.3}\\]\n\n\n4.3.2 What are some of the factors that the PED depends on?\nWhich commodity will have the lower price elasticity of demand?\n\ngasoline or movies?\ninsulin injections (for diabetes patients) or music downloads (on iTunes)?\nalcoholic beverages in general or Miller beer?\n\nA 10 percent increase in gasoline prices reduces gasoline consumption by about 2.5 percent after a year and about 6 percent after five years.

Now, we’ll need to calculate the percent increases from the data And then plug them into the PED formula Price Elasticity of Demand: Calculation Step 1: We arbitrarily call one of the rows Row A and the other row Row B. Step 2: The percentage increase in price is: “Increase” /“Average” ×100 (𝑃_𝐵−𝑃_𝐴)/((𝑃_𝐵+𝑃_𝐴)/2)×100\n(4−2)/((4+2)/2)×100=2/3×100=𝟔𝟔.𝟕\nPrice Elasticity of Demand: Calculation Step 1: We arbitrarily call one of the rows Row A and the other row Row B. Step 3: The percentage increase in quantity demanded is: “Increase” /“Average” ×100 (〖𝑄𝐷〗_𝐵−〖𝑄𝐷〗_𝐴)/((〖𝑄𝐷〗_𝐵+〖𝑄𝐷〗_𝐴)/2)×100\n(8−10)/((8+10)/2)×100=(−2)/9×100=−𝟐𝟐.𝟐\nPrice Elasticity of Demand: Calculation The price elasticity of demand is now easy to calculate “PED”=−“% increase in Quantity Demanded” /“% increase in Price” =−(−22.2)/66.7=0.33 So, a 66.6 percent increase in price caused a 22.2 percent decrease in the quantity demanded Therefore, a 1 percent increase in price caused a 0.33 percent decrease in the quantity demanded That’s the PED\n\n4.5.1 Price Elasticity of Demand: Midpoint Formula\nThe formula used here is called the midpoint formula. Note that you’ll get the same result if you switched the row names. Try it! Price Elasticity of Demand: Example Calculate the PED using the two points highlighted on this demand curve Step 1: Turn the prices and quantities for the two highlighted points into a demand schedule Step 2: Then calculate PED as in the previous example Price Elasticity of Demand: Example The percentage increase in price is: (𝑃_𝐵−𝑃_𝐴)/((𝑃_𝐵+𝑃_𝐴)/2)×100=(4−5)/((4+5)/2)×100=−22.2 The percentage increase in quantity demanded is: (〖𝑄𝐷〗_𝐵−〖𝑄𝐷〗_𝐴)/((〖𝑄𝐷〗_𝐵+〖𝑄𝐷〗_𝐴)/2)×100=(100−50)/((100+50)/2)×100=66.7 “PED”=−“% increase in Quantity Demanded” /“% increase in Price” =−66.7/(−22.2)=3\n\n\n4.5.2 PED and the shape of the demand curve\nElastic, Unit-Elastic and Inelastic Demand Demand can be Inelastic Unit-elastic Elastic … depending on the magnitude of the P.E.D. Inelastic Demand: P.E.D. &lt; 1 Suppose: Price increases by 10% Quantity demanded decreases by 5%. % change in quantity is smaller than the % change in price Here P.E.D. = -(-5/10) = 0.5 &lt; 1 Recall that I am ignoring the negative sign of the P.E.D. In this case, we say demand is inelastic Unit-Elastic Demand: P.E.D. = 1 Suppose: Price increases by 10% Quantity demanded decreases by 10%. % change in quantity is equal to the % change in price Here P.E.D. = -(-10/10) = 1 Recall that I am ignoring the negative sign of the P.E.D. In this case, we say demand is unit-inelastic Elastic Demand: P.E.D. &gt; 1 Suppose: Price increases by 10% Quantity demanded decreases by 30%. % change in quantity is greater than the % change in price Here P.E.D. = -(-30/10) = 3 &gt; 1 Recall that I am ignoring the negative sign of the P.E.D. In this case, we say demand is elastic Perfectly Inelastic and Perfectly Elastic Demand Key Definition: Perfectly Inelastic Demand Quantity demanded does not respond at all to price changes. P.E.D. = 0. Key Definition: Perfectly Elastic Demand Quantity demanded changes infinitely with any change in price. P.E.D. = infinity. The Variety of Demand Curves Because P.E.D. measures how strongly quantity demanded responds to the price, it is closely related to the slope of the demand curve. Key Idea: The higher the price elasticity of demand, the flatter the demand curve.\n\n\n4.5.3 PED affects the link between price and sales revenue\nTotal revenue (TR) is the amount received by sellers from the sale of a good. It is usually computed as the price of the good (P) times the quantity sold (Q): \\(TR=P\\times Q\\).\n\n4.5.3.1 Total Revenue, Graphically\nElasticity and Total Revenue: Inelastic Demand Suppose demand is inelastic Specifically, suppose Price increases by 10%, and Quantity demanded decreases by 4%. Elasticity and Total Revenue: Elastic Demand Suppose demand is elastic Specifically, suppose Price increases by 10%, and Quantity demanded decreases by 25%. Elasticity and Total Revenue: Unit-elastic Demand Suppose demand is unit-elastic Specifically, suppose Price increases by 10%, and Quantity demanded decreases by 10%.\n\n\n4.5.3.2 Elasticity of a Linear Demand Curve\nNote that demand can change from elastic to unit-elastic to inelastic as the price changes. That is, in addition to the other factors discussed before, PED also depends on the price.",

    "text": "4.6 Other important elasticities\n\n4.6.1 Cross Price Elasticity of Demand (CPED)\nThe cross price elasticity of demand (CPED) measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of one good (Good B) to changes in the price of some other good (Good A). Specifically, the CPED for Good B with respect to Good A is:\n\\[\n\\text{Cross Price Elasticity of Demand}=\\frac{\\text{\\% Increase in Quantity Demanded of Good B}}{\\text{\\% Increase in the Price of Good A}}\n\\tag{4.5}\\]\nLet’s consider and example: Suppose the price of Coke increases 2%, and the consumption of Pepsi increases 20%. The CPED for Coke with respect to Pepsi is +20/+2 = +10.\nNow, the CPED for Coke with respect to Pepsi may not be equal to the CPED for Pepsi with respect to Coke. However, we should probably expect these two CPEDs to at least have the same sign.\nThe sign of the CPED gives us a way to distinguish between substitutes and complements.\n\n4.6.1.1 Cross Price Elasticity of Demand: substitutes and complements\nWhen the CPED between two goods is positive, the two goods are called substitutes.\nIn the example involving Coke and Pepsi that we saw a few paragraphs back, an increase in the price of Coke led to an increase in the consumption of Pepsi, confirming our intuition that Coke and Pepsi are substitutes. And the changes in price and quantity demanded also yielded a positive CPED between Coke and Pepsi.\nWhen the CPED between two goods is negative, the two goods are called complements. Suppose the price of gasoline increases 50% and the sale of cars decreases 10%. Then the CPED is -10/+50 = -0.2, which is negative. This is what one would expect, given our commonsense notion that gas and cars are complements.\n\n\n\n4.6.2 Price Elasticity of Supply (PES)\nPrice elasticity of supply is a measure of how strongly the quantity supplied of a good responds to a change in the price of that good. More specifically, the price elasticity of supply is the percent increase in the quantity supplied of a commodity when there is a one percent increase in the price of the commodity, and all other factors that affect quantity supplied are unchanged.\n\\[\n\\textrm{Price Elasticity of Supply}=\\frac{\\textrm{\\% Increase in Quantity Supplied}}{\\textrm{\\% Increase in Price}}\n\\tag{4.6}\\]\n\n4.6.2.1 Determinants of Elasticity of Supply (PES)\nWhat makes the price elasticity of supply high in some cases and low in others?\nThe price elasticity of supply is high if the production technology enables sellers to increase production easily.\nBeach-front land has low price elasticity of supply because increases in the price of beach-front property cannot lead to the creation of more beach-front property. Books, cars, or manufactured goods, on the other hand, have elastic supply. As more of these items can be produced without any significant increase in per-unit production costs, even a small increase in price will induce a big increase in the quantity supplied.\nFinally, if suppliers have more time to respond to a price change then their quantity supplied will also respond more. So, PES is likely to be larger in the long run than in the short run. In the short run, the availability of various productive resources may be fixed. For example, a factory that needs an additional unit of a sophisticated piece of machinery may have to wait six months. Consequently, it may not be able to increase the quantity supplied of its product even if the market price increases sharply.",

Crude oil is the major input in gasoline, so the higher oil prices reduced the supply of gasoline.\nThis led to long lines of cars at gas pumps. Why? Economists blame government regulations that limited the price that oil companies could charge for gasoline.\n\n\n5.1.1.2 CASE STUDY: Rent Control in the Short Run and Long Run\nRent controls are ceilings placed on the rents that landlords may charge their tenants. The goal of rent control policy is to help the poor by making housing more affordable. However, economists tend not to like rent control. One economist called rent control “the best way to destroy a city, other than bombing.”\nThere is an alternative to rent control that may help poor people without causing a housing shortage: taxpayer-funded housing subsidies. There would be no shortage. The quantity supplied would equal quantity demanded. There would be none of the other problems associated with shortages. Specifically, the help would go to the poor and not to those who do not need the help.\nHowever, the tax imposed to pay for the housing subsidies would create problems too.\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Price floors\nA price floor is:\n\nnot binding, if set below the equilibrium price.\nBinding, if set above the equilibrium price.\n\nKey Idea: A binding price floor causes a surplus.\nA surplus is an outcome in which the quantity supplied of a commodity is higher than the quantity demanded. This necessitates non-price rationing, which is an alternative mechanism for rationing the good, using discrimination criteria.\nExamples of price floors are the minimum wage and agricultural price supports.\n\n5.1.2.1 The Minimum Wage\nAn important example of a price floor is the minimum wage. Minimum wage laws dictate the lowest wage any employer may pay.1\nWage subsidies are an alternative to the minimum wage. An example is the earned income tax credit.\nThough better than the minimum wage in some ways, these subsidies are not perfect. They must be paid for by raising taxes, and taxes can have negative effects of their own.\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Health Care: a price-control exception\nIn several advanced countries, such as Japan, the prices of pharmaceutical drugs and medical services are controlled by the government. These governments have decided that the market for health care is in many ways different and that the theory of price control discussed in this chapter is not applicable. When a market is not perfectly competitive, price control may have desirable effects.",

    "text": "5.2 Taxes and subsidies\n\n5.2.1 Taxes\nKey Idea: Governments impose taxes:\n\nto raise revenue for public projects and\nto discourage certain activities that society considers harmful\nto make society less unfair\n\nWhile we will be discussing several negative effects of taxes, they are often essential. Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., associate justice of the US Supreme Court, once said: “Taxes are the price we pay for a civilized society.”\nKey Idea: When a good is taxed”\n\nthe quantity bought and sold is reduced\nbuyers and sellers are both adversely affected\nthe government earns revenue\n\nA tax could be imposed on:\n\nbuyers, or\nsellers, or\nboth\n\nKey Idea: When there is a tax, the price that buyers pay is no longer the same as the price that sellers get.\nSuppose buyers must pay tax $0.50 per ice cream cone. Suppose sellers, who don’t pay the tax, charge $2.00 per cone. Then, the buyers pay $2.50 per cone, including the tax. Note that the price paid by the buyer = the price received by the seller + the tax.\nSuppose sellers pay tax $0.50 per ice cream cone. Suppose buyers, who don’t pay the tax, pay $2.50 per cone. Then, the sellers get $2.00 per cone, after paying the tax. Note that the price paid by the buyer = the price received by the seller + the tax.\nKey Idea: The price paid by the buyer = the price received by the seller + the tax.\nAnother condition that must also be satisfied is that:\nKey Idea: In equilibrium, the quantity demanded at the price paid by buyers must be equal to the quantity supplied at the price received by sellers.\n\n5.2.1.1 What is the impact of a tax?\nWhen a good is taxed:\n\nthe quantity sold is smaller.\nBuyers and sellers share the tax burden.\nBuyers pay a higher price\nSellers receive a lower price\n\n\n\n5.2.1.2 Legal and Economic Incidence\nKey Idea: Whether the law puts the tax on buyers or on sellers is economically irrelevant. The economic effect of a tax is the same (in every way) in either case.\n\n\n5.2.1.3 Elasticity and Tax Incidence\nIn what proportion is the burden of the tax divided between buyers and sellers? Which side bears more of the burden?\nThe answer depends on the price elasticity of demand and the price elasticity of supply.\nKey Idea: The economic burden of a tax falls more heavily on the side of the market that is less elastic.\nIn 1990, the US Congress adopted a new tax on luxury items, such as yachts. The goal was to raise revenue from the rich. The demand for yachts is price elastic, because the rich have lots of substitutes to sailing yachts when it comes to entertainment. The supply of yachts is inelastic, especially in the short run. Therefore, the burden of the tax on yachts fell on the workers who make yachts and not on the rich. The tax was repealed in 1993.\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Subsidies\nKey Definition: A subsidy is the opposite of a tax. Here the government is paying people to reward them for taking some action.\nKey Idea: An activity may be subsidized:\n\nTo encourage an activity that society considers worthy\nTo help people who need help A subsidy will have to be paid for with tax revenues\n\nA subsidy could be given to:\n\nBuyers,\nSellers, or\nBoth\n\nKey Result: Whatever the case, the price received by sellers = the price paid by buyers + the subsidy.\nBut there’s another requirement: In equilibrium, the quantity demanded at the price paid by buyers must be equal to the quantity supplied at the price received by sellers.\nThe effect of a subsidy, for buyers or for sellers, is:\n\nThe equilibrium quantity increases\nThe price paid by buyers falls (So, buyers gain.)\nThe price received by sellers increases (So, sellers gain too.)\nThe buyers’ gain + sellers’ gain = the total subsidy\nThe government must raise taxes – or cut spending – to pay for the subsidy\n\nWhich side gains how much depends on the price elasticities of demand and supply. As in the case of taxes, the effect of a subsidy is higher for whichever side – demand or supply – has the lower price elasticity. For example, if demand is inelastic and supply is elastic, the bulk of the benefits of the subsidy will go to the buyers.",

    "text": "6.3 Measuring the net gain from economic activity: Benefits - Costs\n\n6.3.1 Equilibrium\nWe have shown that the price will be $4, and the quantity bought will be 13 Alex buys 2 donuts; Barbara 4; Chris 3; David 3; and Elena 1 These are the people who like donuts the most Their total happiness = 10 + 9 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = $82 There is no way to distribute 13 donuts among the five people in a way that generates more happiness/willingness-to-pay than $82 Equilibrium: Sellers’ Production Costs We have shown that the price will be $4, and the quantity sold will be 13 Frank sells 5 donuts; Ginny 5; Heather 1; and Irma 2 These are the least-cost producers The total cost = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = $36 There is no way to get 13 donuts produced so that the production cost would be less than $36\n\n\n6.3.2 Optimum\n\n\n6.3.3 Equilibrium is Optimum\nThe equilibrium outcome generates $82 of benefits and $36 of costs, for a total surplus of $46 There is no other outcome that has a higher total surplus\nNext, I will demonstrate this result again, in a different way What’s the Optimum Outcome? Suppose you were a well-intentioned dictator How many donuts would you want made? Which producers would you pick to make the donuts? Which consumers would you pick to consume the donuts? What’s the Optimum Outcome? You are Vladimir, a well-intentioned dictator You want the production to be done as cheaply as possible You want to consumption to generate as much happiness as possible Donut #1: You’ll tell Ginny to make it (cost = $1); You’ll tell Barbara to eat it (benefit = $10); Surplus = $9 What’s the Optimum Outcome? Donut #2: You tell Ginny to make it (cost = $1); You tell Barbara to eat it (benefit = $9); Surplus = $8 Donut #3: You tell Irma to make it (cost = $1); You tell David to eat it (benefit = $9); Surplus = $8 … and so it goes on, till you reach … Donut #13: You tell Frank to make it (cost = $4); You tell Elena to eat it (benefit = $4); Surplus = $0\nWhat’s the Optimum Outcome? Had you ordered the production and consumption of the 14th donut, the cost would have been no less than $5 and the benefit would have been no more than $3 So, the surplus from the 14th donut would have been -$1 Negative! So, you’ll stop at the 13th donut\nWhat’s the Optimum Outcome? Therefore, the optimum outcome would be to order the production and consumption of 13 donuts The producers would be Frank 5 donuts; Ginny 5; Heather 1; and Irma 2 The consumers would be Alex 2 donuts; Barbara 4; Chris 3; David 3; and Elena 1 This is the same as the equilibrium outcome!\nThe Theory of Demand and Supply The theory of demand and supply is super simple It assumes perfect competition, the absence of externalities, and that buyers and sellers are perfectly informed and rational So, it is not surprising that the equilibrium outcome is unimprovable The real world has plenty of inefficiencies Nevertheless, the theory of supply and demand and the welfare analysis of the market outcome is considered by most economists to be a useful starting point in any policy analysis Total Surplus Key Definition: Total Surplus is a monetary measure of the net gain to society from the production and consumption of a good or service. So, Total Surplus = Consumers’ Total Benefit – Producers’ Total Cost\nTotal Surplus = Benefit – Cost Total Surplus = Benefit – Cost MARKET EFFICIENCY How do we judge whether an economy is functioning efficiently? We need to measure the total benefit from consumption. Then we need to subtract the total cost of production. Therefore, a good measure of an economy’s efficiency is its total surplus. Key Definition: An economic outcome is efficient if there is no feasible way to make the total surplus any higher. Total Surplus = Benefit – Cost MARKET EFFICIENCY How do we judge whether an economy is functioning efficiently? One measure of efficiency is the total well-being of all participants in the economy. These are either buyers or sellers, and their total well-being consists of consumer surplus and producer surplus. Therefore, a good measure of an economy’s efficiency is its total surplus. Key Definition: An economic outcome is efficient if there is no feasible way to make the total surplus any higher. MARKET EFFICIENCY Consumer surplus and producer surplus may be used to address the following questions: Is the free market system a good way of running our economy? Could we design a better system? Consumer and Producer Surplus Consumer Surplus = buyers’ total benefit – Amount paid by buyers\nand\nProducer Surplus = Amount received by sellers – sellers’ total cost Total Surplus Key Definition: Total Surplus is a monetary measure of the net gain to society from the production and consumption of a good or service. So, Total Surplus = Consumers’ Total Benefit – Producers’ Total Cost\nIn a market-based economy without taxes and subsidies, Total Surplus = Consumer Surplus + Producer Surplus Total Surplus Total Surplus (in a market-based economy without taxes/subsidies) = Consumer surplus + Producer surplus = buyers’ total benefit – Amount paid by buyers + Amount received by sellers – sellers’ total cost Total Surplus Total Surplus (in a market-based economy without taxes/subsidies) = Consumer surplus + Producer surplus = buyers’ total benefit – Amount paid by buyers + Amount received by sellers – sellers’ total cost = buyers’ total benefit – sellers’ total cost = Total Surplus Consumer and Producer Surplus in the Market Equilibrium Consumer and Producer Surplus in the Market Equilibrium The Best Feasible Outcome What if we produced less than the equilibrium amount? What if we produced more than the equilibrium amount? What if we produced more than the equilibrium amount? Market Efficiency We just saw that there is no feasible way to generate a higher total surplus than the total surplus obtained in the equilibrium outcome under perfect competition. That is, the equilibrium outcome under perfect competition is efficient.\nMARKET EFFICIENCY Three Insights Concerning Market Outcomes Free markets allocate the goods produced to the buyers who value them most highly, as measured by their willingness to pay. Free markets allocate production of goods to those who can produce them at least cost. Free markets produce the quantity of goods that maximizes total surplus. In other words, no economic system will generate more total surplus than the perfectly competitive market system’s equilibrium outcome. The Invisible Hand We pursue our self-interest, not the social interest. It is, therefore, natural to think that the free market would lead us to chaos. And yet, as we just saw, the free market outcome is unimprovable.\n\n\n6.3.4 Market Efficiency: Adam Smith and the Invisible Hand\nThis idea was most famously proposed by Adam Smith (1723 – 1790), the father of modern economics. The Invisible Hand …[E]very individual … neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. … [H]e intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith, 1776\n\n\n6.3.5 Market Efficiency and Social Ethics\nTicket Scalping Ticket scalping is often frowned upon and sometimes considered illegal See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticket_resale But a typical view among economists is that “consenting adults should be able to make economic trades when they think it is to their mutual advantage” Scalping increases the economy’s efficiency\nMarket for organs Should people be allowed to sell, say, their kidneys? The efficiency of the economy will increase. What about fairness? Rich will buy others’ kidneys; the poor will sell theirs. Right now healthy people have extra kidneys while the sick have none. The sale of organs may be more acceptable if organ purchases by the poor were paid for with taxpayers’ money. That way the rich and the poor would have equal access.\n\n\n6.3.6 Market Failure\nBut markets do fail However, markets can go wrong Market Power Externalities Fairness Market Failure: MONOPOLY Our discussion was limited to perfect competition If a market system is not perfectly competitive, firms may have market power. Market power is the ability of a seller to influence prices. The existence of market power can cause markets to be inefficient. Market Failure: EXTERNALITIES Externalities are created when trade between a buyer and a seller affects individuals other than the buyer and the seller. cause total surplus in a market to depend on more than just the benefit to the buyers and cost to the sellers. When buyers and sellers do not take externalities into account when deciding how much to consume and produce, the equilibrium in the market can be inefficient. Market Failure: FAIRNESS In addition to market efficiency, a society might also care about equity – the fairness of the distribution of well-being among the various buyers and sellers. The free market economic system is efficient but not necessarily fair. Health Care: Example of Market Failure In most advanced countries, government policies regarding health care routinely disregard the idea that free markets are best In the United Kingdom, the government builds hospitals, hires doctors and nurses, buys pharmaceutical drugs, and provides medical care to all residents Patients get no bills; tax revenues are used to pay all costs Fees of private doctors are paid by the government Performance indicators are high Costs are low There is virtually no clamor for privatization Video: Scroogenomics Heard the one about the economist who gave cash as a Valentine’s Day gift?
